Chain Bounding
==============

Formalization of the core ideas extracted from G. Incatasciato's proof of Zorn's
Lemma (ZL). It accompanies the paper in collaboration *Chain Bounding and the Leanest
proof of Zorn's Lemma*.

All the results are included in the file `GreatestGoodChain.lean`, and include
  * the existence of a greatest *good* chain for every operator on the powerset
    of a poset;
  * proof of the new principles of *Chain Bounding* and the *Unbounded Chain
    Lemma*;
  * proofs of ZL and the Bourbaki-Witt Fixed Point Theorem using the latter.
